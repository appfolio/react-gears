    React Gears is a library of reusable React Components to support simpler
    front-end development in all of our apps.

    These UI components are in maintenance-mode and are no longer under active development.
    The new direction for implementing the Coastline Design System is [Coastline React](https://developer.appf.io/docs/default/domain/front-end-platform/explanations/coastline-react/)
    which will be exclusively available in the new [Front-end Platform](https://coda.io/d/_dYFR3G4AskL/Unified-Front-end-Platform_suOdZ1dW).
